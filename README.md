 terraform-first-steps

This little project is part of a series Iâ€™m starting to help beginners *actually understand* Terraform by doing, not just reading.  

When I was learning, everything started to make sense once I wrote a simple `main.tf`, ran a few commands, and then **saw something appear in the cloud**. Thatâ€™s exactly what this project is meant to do â€” keep it super simple so you can run it yourself and *see results fast*.

 ðŸ§  What this project does  
- Builds a basic resource with Terraform  
- Shows how `init`, `plan`, and `apply` work  
- Gives you a quick win in the cloud

 ðŸ›  What youâ€™ll need  
- Terraform installed on your machine  
- A cloud account (AWS, Azure, or GCP)  
- CLI set up with your credentials

 ðŸš€ Try it out  
1. Clone this repo  
2. Open your terminal or VS Code  
3. Run:  
   `
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply


4. Go check your cloud console â€” you should see something show up ðŸŽ‰

ðŸ’¡ Why this exists

Learning Terraform is way easier when you build small things step by step. Each project in this series will stay beginner-friendly and hands-on â€” so you can practice and *actually understand whatâ€™s happening*.
