terraform-first-steps

This little project is part of a series I’m starting to help beginners *actually understand* Terraform by doing, not just reading.  

When I was learning, everything started to make sense once I wrote a simple `main.tf`, ran a few commands, and then **saw something appear in the cloud**. That’s exactly what this project is meant to do — keep it super simple so you can run it yourself and *see results fast*.

What this project does  
- Builds a basic resource with Terraform  
- Shows how `init`, `plan`, and `apply` work  
- Gives you a quick win in the cloud

What you’ll need  
- Terraform installed on your machine  
- A cloud account (AWS, Azure, or GCP)  
- CLI set up with your credentials

Try it out  
1. Clone this repo  
2. Open your terminal or VS Code  
3. Run:  
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
````

4. Go check your cloud console — you should see something show up

Why this exists
Learning Terraform is way easier when you build small things step by step. Each project in this series will stay beginner-friendly and hands-on — so you can practice and *actually understand what’s happening*.
